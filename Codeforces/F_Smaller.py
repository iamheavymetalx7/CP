First of all, let's think about how we
should rearrange the two strings
in such a way that ùëé<ùëè (if that
is ever possible). It's always
optimal to arrange ùëé's characters
increasingly in lexicographic order
and ùëè's characters decreasingly.

Since initially both ùëé and ùëè 
contain a character "a", the 
first time ùëè receives any other
letter than "a" the answer will 
always be "YES", because that 
character will always be 
lexicographically larger than ùëé's 
first character which should be "a".

In the other case, we know that ùëè 
doesn't have any other characters 
than "a", so we can compare the 
string ùëé with multiple "a" characters 
and we know that ùëé will be smaller if 
and only if it's only formed of "a"s 
and has a smaller size than ùëè.
